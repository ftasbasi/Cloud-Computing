CENG 495 - Cloud Computing Spring 2020-2021 Homework 1

In this assignment, I implemented a simple Meme Generator using Node.js using Javascript.

For generating meme, I used http://apimeme.com as a source API.

For deployment, I used Google App Engine Services.

I used a sample style code (only CSS part) from https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/ZxbbwO.

Here is my simple meme generator : https://e2041853.uc.r.appspot.com/
