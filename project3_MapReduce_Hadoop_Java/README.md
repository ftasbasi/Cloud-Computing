CENG 495 - Cloud Computing Spring 2020-2021 Homework 3

In this assignment, I developed and deployed a MapReduce application by using Apache Hadoop Packages and Java
language.

Keywords: Cloud Computing, Hadoop, Apache, MapReduce, Java

Project Details:

1. Apache Hadoop

‚Ä¢ Download and install the latest stable release of Apache Hadoop.

‚Ä¢ You must have the required JDK version to use Hadoop.

‚Ä¢ See the useful links section.


2. Specifications
‚Ä¢ This project is developed in Intellij as a Maven solution. You can test it through both in IDE or command prompt.

‚Ä¢ I implemented a Java code with Hadoop environment to analyze the input files

consisting of travel duration information between cities.

‚Ä¢ A folder containing input text files is a must.

‚Ä¢ The inputs will have the following form:

    <CITY_1 > <CITY_2> <DURATION>

‚Ä¢ DURATION can be any integer value more than or equal to 1.

‚Ä¢ For simplicity, we can assume CITY_1 and CITY_2 will be strings consisting of

lowercase ASCII characters.

‚Ä¢ The order of cities (being city 1 or city 2) is not important. No inputs with city 1= city
2 will be given.

‚Ä¢ Different inputs can contain exactly same entries duplicated. We will treat them as
different entries.

‚Ä¢ Our program will execute the following tasks:

a. List the total travel duration. (tot)

b. List the number of occurrences for each city in the data. (city)

c. List the average duration for each route. (avg)

d. Separate the travel data according to the duration of the routes and list the number
of occurrences for each route. First, you will partition the data into 4 parts. i.e. the
routes that takes less than or equal to 5 hours, or ùëëùë¢ùëü ‚â§ 5 will be listed on file
‚Äúpart-r-00000‚Äù, the routes that have duration: 5 < ùëëùë¢ùëü ‚â§ 10 will be listed on file
‚Äúpart-r-00001‚Äù, 10 < ùëëùë¢ùëü ‚â§ 15 will be on ‚Äúpart-r-00002‚Äù and 15 < ùëëùë¢ùëü will be
on ‚Äúpart-r-00003‚Äù. (sep)

‚Ä¢ Precedence is not important for the input but it is important for the output. i.e. input
‚Äúankara istanbul 6‚Äù will be treated same as input ‚Äúistanbul ankara 6‚Äù but the ROUTE
will be outputted as ‚Äúankara-istanbul‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ ROUTE will be a string containing CITY-CITY where cities will be ordered in terms
of their characters (alphabetic precedence).

‚Ä¢ The outputs of MapReduce are sorted according to the keys by default, thus we do
not need to change anything for the order of the outputs.

‚Ä¢ For task d, do not give output with a ROUTE if it does not have any entry within
the required interval for a partition (i.e. there should not be something like ‚Äúardahanedirne 0‚Äù on the ‚Äúpart-r-00000‚Äù output file unless there is a travel data between these
cities that takes less than or equal time of 5 hours.

‚Ä¢ Some routes may have different durations within different entries. So, they will be
counted on different partitions for question d. (See ‚Äúankara-izmir‚Äù on sample input
files.)

‚Ä¢ There can be more than one input file. Our program reads all the files in the
input folder.

‚Ä¢ We can see the input and output formats on the sample input and output files.
Assuming that all of the Java files of our solution exist in the current directory, the
command sequence below will be executed in order to build the solution:
hadoop com.sun.tools.javac.Main *.java
jar cf Hw3.jar *.class

‚Ä¢ The output jar file will be tested with commands given below with different inputs.
hadoop jar Hw3.jar Hw3 tot input output_t
hadoop jar Hw3.jar Hw3 city input output_c
hadoop jar Hw3.jar Hw3 avg input output_a
hadoop jar Hw3.jar Hw3 sep input output_s
